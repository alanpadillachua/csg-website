This presentation gives an overview of many different encryption and encoding schemes. The content ranges from simple encodings, such as ASCII text represented as decimals to classical ciphers, such as Caesar and Vigenere ciphers to modern encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). For modern encryption, there are many different implementation flaws that are discussed in the presentation as well as a few ideas for how to correct those flaws. At the end of the presentation, some thought questions are provided.
