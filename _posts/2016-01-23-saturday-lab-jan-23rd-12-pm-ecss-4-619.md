Hey guys,

Thanks for attending the first Saturday Lab of the 2016 Spring semester. We have a lot planned out for you guys this semester including many guided step by step hands on labs. We will also be doing a lot of CTF preparation as it is CTF season. Please join us **Saturday Lab | Jan 23rd | 12 PM | ECSS 4.619** to learn about how to install virtualbox and using basic commands in the UNIX environment. Here are some of the powerpoints we will be using:
