<p>We had an excellent turnout for our meeting this past Wednesday, but for anyone who was not able to attend the meeting, here are the slides. A few notes have been added for information that was discussed, but not shown on the original slides.</p>
<p>The link for the questionnaire will be live through Wednesday, September 17th EOD. If you have not submitted a response but would like to, you are welcome to do so through then. We are looking at various means of organizing communication within focus groups and will have more info on that soon.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Daniel<br />
CSG President</p>
