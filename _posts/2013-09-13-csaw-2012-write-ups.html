<p>We've had a lot of questions asking how to prepare for the CSAW competition coming up on the 19th. <a href="https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/writeups/" title="write-ups" target="_blank">This is a link to the write-ups for all of the problems from last year.</a> While it won't give you hands-on experience solving the problems, reading a couple write-ups should give you an idea of what the problems are going to be like and hopefully some ideas of where to get started when first looking at a new problem.</p>
