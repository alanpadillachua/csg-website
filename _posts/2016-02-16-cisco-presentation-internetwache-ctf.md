This **Wednesday (February 17th) at 7 PM in SLC 1.102**, we will have Cisco Security Principal Jason Penn coming to discuss the Security Solution internship role (day to day duties/challenges/security at Cisco). Cisco is looking to hire Security Solutions Interns, so please bring your resumes. Cisco representatives will additionally be conducting interviews for these positions the day after the Career Fair on February 19th. Pizza will be provided.

This upcoming weekend, CSG will be participating in the Internetwache Capture the Flag competition. This event will take place from **Feb 20 5am - Feb 21 5pm**. This will be a great opportunity to work on a variety of security skills and compete with others around the world. Feel free to come in and work with us, regardless of your experience level!
If you'd like to work with CSG, we'll be competing as a group in the CSG lab. Keep an eye out for updates regarding when the lab will be open.

We hope to see you all there!
