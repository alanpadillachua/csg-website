We will have lectures and exercises covering SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery, and Server-Side Includes.

The EKOPARTY CTF is this week <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_399432807"><span class="aQJ">on Wednesday</span></span> and <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_399432808"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span>!
