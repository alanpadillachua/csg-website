<p>For those of you that attended the Reverse Engineering crash course yesterday (or anyone who wants to learn a bit more about reversing with IDA), <a href="https://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IDA-Crackme-Intro.pdf" title="IDA intro">here's the link to the PDF writeup that Mitch mentioned</a>. The doc goes over a brief intro to IDA and gives a writeup on the crackme2 problem that he mentioned.</p>
