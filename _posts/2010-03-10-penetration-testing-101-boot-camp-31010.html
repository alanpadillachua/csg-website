<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Mitchell Adair</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 10 March 2010</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Our very first interactive meeting! This was a hands on introduction to the Backtrack penetration testing framework. We performed a mini penetration test, including: using nmap to enumerate a target, using metasploit to exploit the target and dump the hashes, using John the Ripper to crack the password hashes, and more. This was supposed to be an information overload and hopefully inspire some independent study.</p>
