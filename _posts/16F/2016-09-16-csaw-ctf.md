title: CSAW CTF!
---

CSAW starts now! We will be in the CSG lab (ECSS 4.619) today (9/16) from 5-9pm, Saturday from 10am-5pm, and Sunday from 10am-5pm. If you can't manage to come join us and still want to compete, email us at <utdcsg@gmail.com> from your UT Dallas student email and we will reply back with the login information. If you manage to solve a problem, we ask that you email us (<utdcsg@gmail.com>) and let us know which problem you solved, with an optional description of how you solved the problem, as we would like to do write-ups and possibly a presentation of some of the harder problems sometime in the next couple of weeks.
