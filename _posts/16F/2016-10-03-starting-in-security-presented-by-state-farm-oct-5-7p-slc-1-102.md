We will have representatives from the Vulnerability Assessment and Management team at State Farm here as guest speakers to discuss the benefits and challenges of working in the information security field, both in a general sense and specifically at State Farm.

Next week, we will begin our multi-week series of lectures//labs focusing on web security. Join us to learn how to exploit (and defend against) common vulnerabilities in websites.
