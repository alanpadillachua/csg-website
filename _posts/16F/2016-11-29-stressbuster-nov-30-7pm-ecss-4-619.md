title: Stressbuster | Nov. 30, 7pm | ECSS 4.619
---

We will have our final CSG gathering of the semester <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_538916389"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> (<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_538916390"><span class="aQJ">Wednesday</span></span>) night at <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_538916391"><span class="aQJ">7pm</span></span>. We will meet in the CSG lab on the fourth floor of ECSS (ECSS 4.619). Bring board games, computer games, and any security topics you are interested in. We will provide the food. Should be a great opportunity to unwind before the final stretch of the semester.
