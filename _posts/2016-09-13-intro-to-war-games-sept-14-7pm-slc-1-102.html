<div></div>
<div>These exercises are great to spin up on some Linux terminal skills if you are not so familiar with working in that environment. We will have officers and veterans on hand to help you out if you need it. <b><u>BRING A COMPUTER!</u></b> If possible, try to arrive with an SSH client (like PuTTY: <a href="http://www.putty.org" target="_blank">http://www.putty.org</a>) already installed on your computer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The CSAW (Computer Security Awareness Week) CTF will take place from this Friday, September 16 at 5pm until Sunday, September 18 at 5pm. CSG will be competing as a team! We will be working on Friday 5pm-9pm, Satuday 10am-5pm, and Sunday 10am-5pm in the CSG lab (ECSS 4.619). No RSVP necessary; just come hang out whenever you can and help the team!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Last thing: Next Wednesday evening (9/21), we are looking forward to a tech talk from Cisco's security team. Look forward to more detail on this in the coming days.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As always, contact me with any questions or concerns. Looking forward to seeing you Wednesday!</div>
