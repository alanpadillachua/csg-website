<p>Kevin Henson from the Cyber Defense Labs will be discussing practices for resumes and interviews. Students are more than welcome to bring their resumes in electronic format (such as word document) if they are comfortable submitting them for group critique. Names and identifying information can be redacted if preferred.</p>
<p>February 18th 7:00 - 8:30 pm | ECSS 2.412</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!-Jia<br />
