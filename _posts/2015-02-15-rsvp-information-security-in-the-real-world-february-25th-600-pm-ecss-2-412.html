<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Fisch, Senior Vice President of Information Security at Texas Capital Bank, will be giving a Q&amp;A on Information Security in the "real-world." Please let us know by the end of Sunday February 23rd if you will be attending this event. This is to get a headcount expectation for ordering food. Do not respond more than once.</p>
