There will be an open lab this Saturday at 12pm in ECSS 4.619 as usual.

In addition to that, there is an event coming up April 24-25: The Semi-Annual Cyber Security Conference, hosted by the North Texas ISSA. While not a CSG event, the conference will cover many security topics and might be worth checking out. Students can get in for $15 ($20 at the door).

The conference will be held at Collin College. I know some students live on campus and do not have access to transportation. If you want to attend but need a ride, send a message to the group email.
On that same note, if you'd be willing to give rides to other students, note the group as well!
