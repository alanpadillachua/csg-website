title: Bug Hunting, Binary Patching
---

**Presenter**: Mitchell Adair

**Date**: 10 Feb 2012

**Description**: In this presentation we introduce how to patch programs at the binary level, in particular using IDA. We fix the sign bug and format string bug in echoserver. We go over redirecting program flow, rearranging the stack, executing a proper/patched function call, and jumping back into regular program flow.
