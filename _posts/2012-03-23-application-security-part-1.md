**Presenter**: Kevin Hulin

**Date**: 23 Mar 2012

**Description**: This week, we begin our discussion of Application Security with an overview of common programming mistakes and some techniques for combating them. We also go into some detail about the more formal approaches to application security including Model Checking and Symbolic Execution. We end with a CTF-style reverse engineering demonstration of Fuzzgrind, a fuzzer based on Symbolic Execution and Constraint Solving.
