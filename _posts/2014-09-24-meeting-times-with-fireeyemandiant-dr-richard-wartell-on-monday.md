As mentioned at tonight's meeting, UTD alumni Dr. Richard Wartell and his co-worker Evan Pena will be on UTD campus this coming Monday. They are giving a talk on security and what they do at Mandiant (a FireEye company) at 1pm in the TI Auditorium. I expect it to be a very interesting presentation and would encourage anyone available at that time to attend. A flyer is attached ([wartell-flier](https://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wartell-flier.pdf)) with details about the talk.

They would also like to meet with CSG members separately, with some recruiting interest involved. We have scheduled to meet with them from 4pm-5pm on Monday in ECSS 4.910. This time was chosen based on the responses we received from the survey posted earlier based on the number of people available at that time. Feel free to come anytime within that hour as it will be an informal meeting and discussion.

For those who are not able to attend either the 1pm presentation, nor the 4-5pm meeting but are interested in job opportunities with Mandiant/FireEye, you can let us know via the CSG email (utdcsg@gmail.com) and we will get you in touch with them.

Thanks,
Daniel
CSG President
