<p>This Wednesday, 2/20 at 7:00 pm, we will meet in ECSS 4.619 and begin covering Network Security. This week we'll cover WPA and WEP cracking, a Wireshark tutorial, and wireless sniffing. This should be a very interesting and relevant presentation, especially now that wireless is so prevalent. Hope to see you there!</p>
