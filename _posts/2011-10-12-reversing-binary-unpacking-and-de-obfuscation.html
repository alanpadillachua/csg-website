<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: James McFadyen, Jacolon Walker, Mitchell Adair</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 12 Oct 2011</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is part 2 of the reverse engineering section, and it's a two part presentation. We begin with how to recognize when a binary is unpacked, and how to defeat and unpack common packers such as UPX. Next, we go over static and dynamic binary obfuscation: how to recognize it, and how to defeat it.</p>
