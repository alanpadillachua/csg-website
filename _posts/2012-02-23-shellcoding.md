**Presenter**: Kenneth Miller

**Date**: 23 Mar 2012

**Description**: Introduction to shellcoding; what shellcoding is, how it works, and a basic overview of how to craft it. This presentation briefly touches on calling convention differences between 32 and 64 bit OS's, and conventions specific to OS's. This presentation does not include a demo, but summarizes a walkthrough significantly. Lastly, it acknowledges some practical shellcoding problems in real exploits, such as escaping UTF conversion, making shellcode printable, and self modifying shellcode for getting around difficult exclusory rules like null byte termination or specific bytes.
