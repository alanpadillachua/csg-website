---

**Presenters**: Camron Q., Kevin Hulin, Donald Talkington

**Date**: 1 Sep 2011

**Description**: This is part 1 of our 4 week Crypto module. This was an introduction to the subject, including terminology and basic ciphers such as Caesar, Vigenere, and Hill. Hashes, symmetric and assymetric encryptions are discussed as well. Steganography is the last section of the presentation, and 2 cool at home assignments are given out. Good luck ;)
