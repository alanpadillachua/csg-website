title: Reversing - Mobile Application Analysis on Android
---

**Presenters**: James McFadyen, Jacolon Walker, Mitchell Adair

**Date**: 20 Oct 2011

**Description**: This is part 3 of our reversing month. This time we take a look at android applications. This is an introduction to the subject and discusses how to unpack android applications, analyze the byte-code, convert the byte-code to java for easier analysis, determine what permissions a program uses, and finally we end with how to emulate the program and run it locally.
