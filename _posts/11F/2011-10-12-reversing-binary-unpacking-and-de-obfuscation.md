title: Reversing - Binary Unpacking and De-obfuscation
---

**Presenters**: James McFadyen, Jacolon Walker, Mitchell Adair

**Date**: 12 Oct 2011

**Description**: This is part 2 of the reverse engineering section, and it's a two part presentation. We begin with how to recognize when a binary is unpacked, and how to defeat and unpack common packers such as UPX. Next, we go over static and dynamic binary obfuscation: how to recognize it, and how to defeat it.
