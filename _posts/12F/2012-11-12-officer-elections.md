title: Officer Elections
---

We're holding officer elections at the meeting this Wednesday. Be sure to get there on time if you want to vote.

The Officer Positions are:

-   <span style="line-height: 22px;">President</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 22px;">Vice President</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 22px;">Secretary</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 22px;">Treasurer (webmaster)</span>

For an idea of each position's responsibilities, see [this](http://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/csg-officers.pdf)Â form. The details might change a bit next semester, but it should be pretty similar.

If you are interested in running for Office, send an email with your name, the Position you'd like, and a short paragraph explaining why you are qualified to <utdcsg@gmail.com>. (Sorry, no running for multiple Offices this time)
