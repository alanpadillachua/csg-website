title: 'This Week: Malware Analysis'
---

**Wednesday 11/14** @ ECSS **4.619**

This is our second week of covering malware. Last week's presenters covered how malware works and showed how attackers can hide malicious code on a victim's system. This week, we'll be covering techniques and tools for analyzing what a piece of malware does. This info will come in handy next week when we have a hands-on malware analysis lab.
