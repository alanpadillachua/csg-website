title: Fuzzing 2
---

**Presenter**: Mitch Adair

**Date**: 12 Sept 2012

**Description**: We continue where we left off from Part 1. This section covers 2 main topics, debugging libraries and fuzzer design. For debugging libraries we go over PyDBG and WinAppDbg, discussing basic to intermediate examples, and when you might want to use one instead of the other. After that, fuzzer design is discussed, including goals, design choices, architecture, etc. Some code samples are shown from my fuzzer, along with a github link for those who are interested.
