<p>Bring your resume and join us in JO 4.614 this Wednesday Nov 19th at 7pm. We will be hosting some guests from Raytheon's security engineering team who will be here for a presentation, Q&amp;A, and accepting resumes and speaking to interested students.</p>
<p>Even if you are not seeking a position within the next 6-9 months, this is an excellent opportunity to learn more about Raytheon as an employer and make a connection with them. For those not able to attend this meeting due to class schedules, there will be information posted here after tomorrow's meeting on how to contact the representatives directly.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these positions do require eligibility to work in the U.S. without a visa, as eligibility for federal government security clearances is a requirement.</p>

<p>UPDATE: For those who were unable to attend the meeting but would like to submit resumes, you can email Jesse Lee at jesse@raytheon.com . You will also need to apply for positions via raytheon.com/campus but Jesse is another point of contact locally.</p>
