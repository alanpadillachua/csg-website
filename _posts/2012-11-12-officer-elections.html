<p>We're holding officer elections at the meeting this Wednesday. Be sure to get there on time if you want to vote.</p>
<p>The Officer Positions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">President</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">Vice President</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">Secretary</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">Treasurer (webmaster)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For an idea of each position's responsibilities, see <a href="http://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/csg-officers.pdf">this</a>Â form. The details might change a bit next semester, but it should be pretty similar.</p>
<p>If you are interested in running for Office, send an email with your name, the Position you'd like, and a short paragraph explaining why you are qualified to <a href="mailto:utdcsg@gmail.com">utdcsg@gmail.com</a>. (Sorry, no running for multiple Offices this time)</p>
