<p>James (aka: jtm) collected some great resources, some of which were showcased during our first meeting this past Wednesday the 22nd.  The other resources that Daniel (aka: drx) mentioned have been added to the 'Resources.txt' file contained within the download.  The links within that document that were highlighted during the meeting have also been marked as such.</p>
<p>As we are going to be diving into code auditing, reverse engineering, and exploitation starting next week, we encourage everyone to take a look at these resources ahead of time.  Our open-lab time from 11am until 4pm this Saturday the 25th in ECSS 4.619 will be a great time and place to do so as many of the officers and James will be present.</p>
<p>As always, feel free to ask questions and make contributions.  We monitor the utdcsg@gmail.com email as well as the #utdcsg IRC channel.</p>
<p>Download the resources here: <a title="Resources.txt" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1582732/Resources.txt" target="_blank">Resources.txt</a></p>
