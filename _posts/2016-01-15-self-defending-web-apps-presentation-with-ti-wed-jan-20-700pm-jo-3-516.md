I hope everyone had an enjoyable break and is ready for the new semester.
CSG will be starting the semester off with a presentation on January 20 about Self-Defending Web Apps, hosted by **Texas Instruments** Security Architect, Keith Holt. The presentation will begin at **7 pm in room JO 3.516** ( map: [\[link\]](http://www.utdallas.edu/locator/JO_3.516) )

Our first open lab will be on January 23 in ECSS 4.619 from 12 - 4 pm. During our first open lab, we will be providing introduction courses to our new members and existing members who would like to refresh on basic Unix commands and installing virtual machines. **Free Pizza** will be provided to all attendants.
