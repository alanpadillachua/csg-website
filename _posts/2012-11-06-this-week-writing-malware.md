**Wednesday 11/7** @ ECSS **4.619**

We're beginning our malware section this week, starting with malware programming techniques. We'll be covering some cool malware coding topics, including bypassing antivirus scanners, command and control methods, persistence, and more. This should be a really interesting topic and we encourage anyone interested in learning more about malware to attend.

Hope to see you there!
