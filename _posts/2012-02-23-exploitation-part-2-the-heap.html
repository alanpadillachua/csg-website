<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Scott Hand</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 23 Feb 2012</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: For the second part of our exploitation section, we looked at heap based exploitation. We introduce the fundamentals of dynamic memory allocation and highlight several exploitable properties. These ideas are put into practice in a set of heap overflow challenges from <a href="http://www.exploit-exercises.com/">exploit-exercise.com</a>'s Protostar VM. We walk through the first three. Other uses of heap space such as heap spraying are mentioned.</p>
