title: 'UPDATED with Slides: Wednesday, September 24th Meeting Topic'
---

Tomorrow at 7pm we will have a guest speaker at our meeting in JO 4.614. Kevin Henson will be presenting on the topic of SCADA systems security. These are systems used for industrial control and monitoring, and exploits on these systems can result in a wide range of effects in the physical realm. Large-scale power outages, extensive damage to machinery and equipment necessary for utilities and ensuring safety, and disruption of communication channels are all possible results from successful attacks on these types of systems.  Join us tomorrow evening to hear more from Kevin about this area of computer security.
