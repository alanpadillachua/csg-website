There will be a CSG meeting this Wednesday, October 22nd, at 7:00pm CDT in room JO 4.614. We are currently awaiting confirmation for a Digital Forensics presentation. However, if it cannot be arranged, there will be an introduction to Linux server hardening presented by CSG's president, Daniel.

Turned out Kevin was able to show up and we got a very nice presentation on Digital Forensics. For those who attended and those who were no table to make it, here are the slides from the presentation.
