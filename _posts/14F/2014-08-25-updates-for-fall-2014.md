title: Updates for Fall 2014
---

I hope everyone had an enjoyable break over the summer. A few quick updates about CSG activities this semester as we get started this fall.

We will be having our first general meeting of the semester Wednesday, September 10th at 7pm in our lab (ECSS 4.619). If we can get a larger room reserved for this semester in time, we will change locations but send out an update and place a sign on the door. During this meeting we will give a bit of introduction to the CSG for those of you who are new, and we will also be discussing some topic ideas for presentations and activities during this semester.

Our first Open Lab will take place on the following Saturday, September 13th from 12pm until 4pm in our lab. For those of you not familiar with these, our Open Labs are a great time to meet some other members of various experience levels and see more about what interests you, or find something new you may want to learn more about.

We're looking forward to this semester, and we hope to see as many people as are able to make it.

Thanks,
Daniel
CSG President
