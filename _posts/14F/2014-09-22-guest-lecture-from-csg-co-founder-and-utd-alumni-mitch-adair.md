As announced via our mailing list earlier, Mitch gave an introduction to Reverse Engineering as a guest lecturer in Dr. Lin's class this morning, and will be giving the second part this evening. He has provided us with a copy of his slides, resource files used in the hands-on portions, and a screencast of his presentation this morning. All are available via the link below.

UPDATE: The screencast from the second lecture has been added to the link below.
