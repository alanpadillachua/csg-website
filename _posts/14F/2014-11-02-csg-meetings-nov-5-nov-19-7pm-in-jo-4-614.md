Location: JO 4.614

Time: November 5th at 7 pm

This Wednesday we encourage everyone who has been involved thus far this semester, or intends to be involved next semester to attend our meeting at 7pm in JO 4.614. At that meeting we will be having some group discussion about planning for next semester, and also discussing officer roles/elections for next semester. There are also a few items of possible interest that I have been working on setting up for the CSG that will be introduced to the group then. These include some new lab equipment, and some potential partnerships with some companies and security professional groups in the area who are interested in supporting student activities in our group. (Email from our president: Daniel)
