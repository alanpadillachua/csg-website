Due to the weather conditions on Wednesday evening, the talk with Dr. Eric will be postponed. The date is yet to be decided. We apologize for these delays!

The mock interview session, however, is still happening this Saturday, March 7 at 11am. There are still spots open, so be sure to grab yours here: [\[link\]](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JbDboHuWAfkCg5hQ-3SDmWrVy9H0oJis85-K44bnbdk/viewform?c=0&w=1)
