[Server Hardening/Defense Week 1 Slides](http://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/server_hardening_1.pptx)

The first week was a good intro to the topic, and we started to get a bit into some Linux specific stuff. I hope you'll join us next week when we'll dive deeper into how to setup defenses on a Linux server. Then in week 3 we'll get heavy into the world of Windows server defense.
