<p>CSG has recently acquired <b>JO 3.516</b> for the Saturday lab sessions. It is located one floor below, and slightly south of the room used for the Wednesday meetings. The room has been reserved for the rest of the semester. It's a lecture hall, which means more space and less tripping over chairs!</p>
<p>Our first lab will be in the new room this Saturday (9/13) from 12-4 pm. We hope to see you there!</p>
<p>-Corrin Thompson<br />
CSG Secretary</p>
