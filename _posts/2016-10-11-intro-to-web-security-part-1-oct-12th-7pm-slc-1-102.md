Meeting number six will take place at the normal place/time (This <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1111742272"><span class="aQJ">Wednesday, 10/12 at 7pm</span></span> in SLC 1.102). In this meeting, we begin a three part series on web security. We will cover various topics across SQL injection, cross site scripting, and more. If possible, install [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/) beforehand, as we will be using it during the lecture and exercises.

The contact information of the State Farm representatives from last week is only available through contacting the CSG email: utdcsg@gmail.com
