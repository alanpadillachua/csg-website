<p>Hey guys,</p>

We will also be doing a lot of CTF preparation as it is CTF season. Please join us <strong>Saturday Lab | Jan 23rd | 12 PM | ECSS 4.619 </strong>to learn about how to install virtualbox and using basic commands in the UNIX environment. Here are some of the powerpoints we will be using:</p>
