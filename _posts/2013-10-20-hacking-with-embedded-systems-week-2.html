<p>Even though a lot of our demos decided not to work (I suspect not enough sacrifices to the demo gods) I think we were still able to go over a lot interesting things like getting a full-fledged version of Kali working on a Raspberry Pi, and turning a Raspberry Pi into a honeypot! I wish the other demos didn't crumble, so we could've seen a wifi pineapple in action, but it just leaves room for more activities in the future!</p>
<p>Here are Matt's slides from his presentation on the Raspberry Pi honeypot (Glastopf Pi): <a href="https://csg.utdallas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Honeypots_Pi.pdf">Raspberry Pi Honeypot</a></p>
