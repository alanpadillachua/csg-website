**Presenter**: Mitchell Adair

**Date**: 18 Jan 2012

**Description**: In the bug hunting sessions (3 total) we are taking a custom service, echoserver, and reversing it, finding vulnerabilities in it, developing exploits for it, and creating in-line assembly patches to fix the vulnerabilities. I'm linking the virtual machine which has all the information (including the solutions, and other challenges) in a pre-setup environment. I'm also linking the echoserver itself, along with some other materials in case you just want them by themselves.
