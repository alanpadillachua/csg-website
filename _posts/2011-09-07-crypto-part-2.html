<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: Camron Q., Kevin Hulin, Donald Talkington</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 7 Sep 2011</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: In part 2 of our 4 week Crypto module, we go over some common sense dos and don'ts. We also take a more in-depth look at block ciphers and the underlying security flaws that can leave a crypto system vulnerable (and score points in CTFs). We conclude with a hands on demo CTF problem to motivate participation in upcoming CTFs.</p>
