<p>CSG + ACM will be hosting a information session with Crowe Horwath this Thursday, Oct. 15th at 8:30 PM in the TI Auditorium. This will be an informal Q&amp;A/information session about the company where you will get another chance to speak with alumni and recruiters. It will be less technical than the workshop and there will be cool swag and free pizza!</p>
<p>We are also hosting a Saturday open lab and we will continue to do hands on workshops. Free pizza will be provided as always and we are meeting in <b>JO 4.614</b> instead of our regular lab from 12pm-4pm.</p>
<p>Jiayang Wang<br />
CSG Vice President</p>
