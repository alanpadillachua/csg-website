This week we are doing a Digital Forensics Workshop! We'll be doing some hands-on work with a computer image file using Forensics Toolkit. To reduce setup time, these are the materials we will be using:

-   [Forensics Toolkit Application](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iji4zqvtft8gjnh/ftk181.exe?dl=0)
-   [Precious image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sppzraonushdcmt/precious.img?dl=0)
-   [Steganography images + Quick Stego tool](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jk21qqqlsvs5wtg/Part%203-Steganography%20Images.zip?dl=0)

Kevin Henson from Cyber Defense Labs will be leading the lab. He's had years of experience in Digital Forensics, and will have valuable insight for anyone interested in forensics. The event will take place at **7pm** in **JO 4.614** on **March 30.**

We hope to see you there!
