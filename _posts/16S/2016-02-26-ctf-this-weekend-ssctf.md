title: CTF this weekend (SSCTF)
---

**CSG will not be participating in this CTF as a group**

However, we felt it would be best to bring the CTF to your attention in the event you would like to participate on your own teams. It runs from 27 Feb. 2016, 00:00 UTC â€” 29 Feb. 2016, 00:00 UTC.

Official website: http://lab.seclover.com/

You can still register even though the CTF has started! It would be good practice.

CSG will be participating in Boston Key Party on March 4.
