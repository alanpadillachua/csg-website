The alumni CTF can be found here: <http://10.176.169.16/>

Any URLs for Raytheon should be replaced with the above IP address!

It's only accessible via the UTD network. We'll keep the CTF up until Saturday this weekend. Feel free to make your own teams and try it out! We'll probably spend most of the Saturday lab on that instead of Server Hardening, since we didn't have much time to work on the CTF prior to the presentations this week.
