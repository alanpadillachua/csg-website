title: Buffer Overflows (stack)
---

**Presenter**: Mitchell Adair

**Date**: 21 Apr 2010

**Description**: This is an introduction to stack based overflows. A quick review of virtual memory and processor registers is given, then we take a look at 3 different vulnerable C programs. Each one of these programs’ vulnerability is show, then exploited. I’m also releasing an Ubuntu virtual machine (vmware) with a nicely setup environment containing the challenges and solutions.
