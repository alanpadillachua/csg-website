There will be a meeting **Wednesday, April 22nd at 7:00pm in ECSS 2.201**! Kevin Henson from Cyber Defense Labs will be ending the semester with a followup social engineering workshop.
We'll also be holding **officer elections** at the meeting! If you'd like to be in an officer position, note the group or come to Wednesday's meeting.

And, as a last reminder, ISSA's Second Semi-Annual Cyber Security Conference will be held April 24-25.
