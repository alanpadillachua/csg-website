We will be having our sixth meeting in ECSS 2.311, March 1st, 2017 at
7:00pm. We will be covering x86 assembly using GDB in a multi-part reverse
engineering series.

To prepare for this meeting, please come with the following:

Either:

* A Linux VM prepared with gdb, gcc, and the files here: <https://csg.utdallas.edu/assets/x86intro/x86code.zip>
* Virtualbox, Vagrant, and our Vagrantfile: <https://csg.utdallas.edu/assets/x86intro/Vagrantfile>

To use Vagrant, load command prompt/terminal in the directory that contains the Vagrant file and run `vagrant up`
