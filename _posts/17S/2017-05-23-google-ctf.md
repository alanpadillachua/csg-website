CSG is competing in Google CTF Friday, June 17 to Sunday, June 19. To work remotely, email <utdcsg@gmail.com> from your UT Dallas email account for the password, and join us in IRC in #utdcsg on OFTC. The lab (ECSS 4.619) will be open from 19:00 to 00:00 on Friday, June 17 and from 10:00 to 22:00 on Saturday, June 18 to work on the competition.

We plan to compile write ups for the problems members solve, so we would greatly appreciate it if you would write down the steps you took to solve a problem. These write ups can be emailed to <utdcsg@gmail.com>.
