title: CSAW 2012 Writeups
---

It seems the previous link was down. So... [Here's another link to writeups.](http://sysexit.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/csaw-ctf-2012-quals-write-ups/) It's not as good as the last one but it seems to have most of the problems, and the link works. CSAW will be kicking off tomorrow at 5pm and we'll be up in our lab (ECSS 4.619) we hope to see you there!

Check out the presentation section for tonight's presentation on Windows Patch Diffing.
