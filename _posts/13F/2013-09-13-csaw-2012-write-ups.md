title: CSAW 2012 Write-ups
---

We've had a lot of questions asking how to prepare for the CSAW competition coming up on the 19th. [This is a link to the write-ups for all of the problems from last year.](https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/writeups/ "write-ups") While it won't give you hands-on experience solving the problems, reading a couple write-ups should give you an idea of what the problems are going to be like and hopefully some ideas of where to get started when first looking at a new problem.
