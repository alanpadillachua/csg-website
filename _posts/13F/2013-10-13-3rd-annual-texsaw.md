TexSAW is where University, governmental, and industry experts in cyber security (including data mining and malware detection) share innovative research behind combating existing threats and slowing the spread of new dangers. The three day event features tutorials, a symposium, and panel discussion as well as student workshops and competition.

This year TexSAW will be on 10/29 (conference), and 10/30 - 10/31 (Student workshops and competition).
