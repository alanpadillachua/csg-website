We will be doing a hands on **introduction to web security** during our open lab this **Saturday January 30th at 12pm in ECSS 4.619**. We will be exploring areas such as SQL injection, Cross Site Scripting, and Cross Site Request Forgery. This is an intro lab and members do not need prior experience. **Free Pizza** will be provided for everyone who attends. It is also a great way to get experience in how databases work.
