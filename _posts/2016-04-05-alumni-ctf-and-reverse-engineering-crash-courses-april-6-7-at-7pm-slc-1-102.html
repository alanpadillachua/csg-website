<p>This is a packed week in regards to CSG events. Sometime this week, we will be putting up a virtual machine on the website that you all can use for practising the format of CTF problems.</p>
<p><span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1870565558"><span class="aQJ">On Wednesday</span></span> and <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1870565559"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> evenings, CSG founders Mitch Adair and James McFadyen will be hosting Reverse Engineering Parts 1 and 2 crash courses. Part 1 will include the differences between x86 (what the reversing presentation is focused on) and ARM, and do an intro to ARM. Part 2 will go into further depth on the topics covered in part 1 and will also be used for going over problems from the CTF virtual machine. For both nights, the crash courses will be located in <b>SLC 1.102 </b>from <b><span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1870565560"><span class="aQJ">7-9 PM</span></span>.<br />
