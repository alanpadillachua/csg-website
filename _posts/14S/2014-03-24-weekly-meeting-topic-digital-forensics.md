Join us this Wednesday, March 26 as Kevin (aka: wompa) shares his expertise on the area of Digital Forensics.  This is an especially interesting area of security given its pervasiveness today.  Come find out more about how people try to hide their secrets, or evidence of guilt, and how much can be uncovered.

As usual, our meeting will be at 7pm in SLC 1.204
