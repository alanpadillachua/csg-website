Week 2 of our series on Code Auditing, Reverse Engineering, and Exploitation will be held in [SLC 1.204](http://www.utdallas.edu/locator/SLC_1.204), located north of ECSN.  Join us as Daniel (aka: drx) and James (aka: jtm) continue this three week series.  The posted resources from last week's meeting are a great place to refresh your memory, or catch up if you couldn't make it last week.

Also, don't forget our Saturday open-lab sessions held in our permanent lab in ECSS 4.619 from 11am-4pm.  This weekend may be a bit different as we have the Sochi Olympic CTF this weekend starting on Friday.  More updates about that will be forthcoming.
