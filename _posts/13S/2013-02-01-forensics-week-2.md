title: Forensics - Week 2
---

Alright guys, hopefully you caught our week 1 intro to Digital Forensics. This coming Wednesday we'll be going more in depth and showing off some of the tools, techniques and artifacts used in Digital Forensics. We hope to see you there!

Important Note - due to our large turn out we may be getting a larger room but there's nothing concrete yet so stay tuned for updates.
