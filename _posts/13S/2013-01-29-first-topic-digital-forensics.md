This week we will meet and start our three week discussion on digital forensics. Come out this week for our intro to forensics: what it is, how it's used, and words you need to know to sound like you know what you're talking about. Usual time, usual place (Wednseday 7pm, ECSS 4.619) We hope to see you there!
