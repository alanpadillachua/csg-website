title: First Meeting - Spring '13
---

The spring semester has begun and that means it's time for the CSG to start back up! Our first meeting will be on Wednesday January 23rd at 7pm in our normal headquarters (ECSS 4.619). We will be discussing which topics to cover this semester, so think about what you'd like to learn and come to the meeting with plenty of ideas.
