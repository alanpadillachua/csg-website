This is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in cybersecurity.

To volunteer, fill out the form here: <https://www.csc.tntech.edu/wicys/register/>

Fill out the application for the Student Scholarship, and be sure to mention in the final question that you want to be a volunteer for UTD. The deadline is **December 1st**, but get it done as soon as possible to guarantee a spot. Volunteering is open to *both* males and females.

If you're accepted as a volunteer, you'll be given a scholarship that will pay for food/lodging. Basically the conference will be at no cost to you!
